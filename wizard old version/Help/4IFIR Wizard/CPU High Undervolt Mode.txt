This setting contols the Undervolt logic in 4IFIR for frequencies 16XX MHz and higher.

The higher the level, the lower the consumption at frequencies above 16xx Mhz

To test the stability:
1. Set the maximum available CPU frequency.
2. Turn off the Governor (4IFIR Shaitan/Miscellaneous/Frequency Governor).
3. Run some games.
