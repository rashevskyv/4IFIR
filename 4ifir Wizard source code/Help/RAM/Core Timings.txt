Core Timings for RAM allow for independent fine-tuning of specific timing parameters.
Core Timings do not affect each other.

Tune each parameter individually to achieve maximum stable performance.

You may see a notation like this:

3-6-6-5-5-5-3-4 or 36655534

Each number coresponds to the Core Timings setting. 
For example, 3 - Core Timings 1;
6 - Core Timings 2, etc.
