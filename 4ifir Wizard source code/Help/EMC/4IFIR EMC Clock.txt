This setting controls the frequency of EMC in 4IFIR Optimized S.

Higher MHz means faster performance, but excessive values can lead to issues like corrupted data (e.g., emuNAND) and visual artifacts. 
Ensure compatibility and consider your RAM model when setting.

Also keep in mind that the lower voltages on CPU, GPU, the lower maximum EMC Frequency available.
