Timings Orchestrator for EMC allow for independent fine-tuning of specific timing parameters.
Mostly Core Timings do not affect each other. 

Tune each parameter individually to achieve maximum stable performance.

You may see a notation like this:

3-6-6-5-5-5-3-4 or 36655534

Each number coresponds to the Core Timings setting. 
For example, 3 - Core Timings 1;
6 - Core Timings 2, etc.

0 timing values are for debugging. 
If in some scenario 0 works stably, but 1 does not work, 
this is a reason to report the combination of parameters,
memory chips, etc.
