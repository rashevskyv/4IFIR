This menu allows you to control the fan speed at different temperature ranges.

For each range, the fan speed at the left end is the max speed of the previous range 
(for 16°C - 35°C - it's 0%).

The sliders follow 2 main rules:
- The max fan speed cannot be lower than the max speed of the previous range.
- The max fan speed cannot be higher that the max speed of the next range.

Adjustments for both of those rules happen in real-time.
