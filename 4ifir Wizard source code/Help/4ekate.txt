4ekate is a set of optimizations for payload-based files, which allows you to get an additional 200-300MB of bandwidth if set to ST2.

If you have issues to set this setting to ST2, make sure that the 4ekate is in the Default ST and there is no 4IFIX installed.

If console do not start or have issues with sleep mode after applying 4ekate settings, try installing 4ekate / 4IFIX from AIO or replace payloads with a new one to solve it.

Directories of payload files:
/payload.bin
/atmosphere/reboot_payload.bin
/bootloader/update.bin
/bootloader/payloads/fusee.bin
