Speed Shift is the secret component of 4IFIR, that allows you to open the full potential of your console.

Technically has no affect on stability if CPU Minimal Voltage is stable.

The higher the value, the lower the consumption and the less aggressive CPU Governor.

If there's lack of perfomance of the CPU, try to disable CPU Governor or decrease Speed Shift.
