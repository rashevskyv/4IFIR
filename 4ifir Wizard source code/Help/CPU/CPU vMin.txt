The CPU Minimal Voltage controls the lowest voltage available for CPU underclocking. 

The lower minimal voltage, the lower power consumption and lower Maximum EMC Frequency available

To test it, select the voltage, reboot, then after the reboot set the EMC Frequency to Optimized S on Temp Overrides and set the CPU Frequency to minimum. 

When it frezees, press the console's power button for 12 seconds to shut it down. Boot into the system, set higher minimal voltage and repeat until stable..
